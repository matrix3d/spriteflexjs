DESCRIPTION

The DividedContainerExample demonstrates the Royale DividedContainer components: HDividedContainer and
VDividedContainer. These contains separate their children using interactive dividers, allowing
you to resize them.

The HDividedContainer arranges its children into columns while the VDividedContainer arranges its
children into rows.

The DividedContainer is built from sub-components and beads, most of which can be substituted
with other compatible beads or even custom beads you write. The substitutions can be
made in MXML but are most often done in CSS.
