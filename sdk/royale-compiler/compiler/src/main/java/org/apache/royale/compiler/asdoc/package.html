<body>

This package contains interfaces related to ASDoc,
the documentation system for AS and MXML APIs.

<p>
The ASDoc subsystem is not currently implemented in Royale.
These interfaces provide the basis for a future implementation,
which would support the production of HTML ASDoc files,
the production and use of DITA files inside SWCs,
and the display of API documentation in a Flex IDE.
