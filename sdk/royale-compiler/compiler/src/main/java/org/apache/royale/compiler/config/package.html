This package contains classes and interfaces related to the configuration subsystem.

<p>
The configuration subsystem handles reading options from the command line,
from configuration files like <code>flex-config.xml</code>,
and from in-memory buffers.
It is mostly legacy code from the original <code>mxmlc</code> compiler,
with some simplifications.
</p>

<p>
This package also contains the common configuration options, defaults,
and path resolver classes.
