This package contains interfaces related to inter-definition <i>references</i>.

<p>
Definitions typically refer to other definitions indirectly, by name,
using an <code>IReference</code>.
This indirection scheme allows definitions to be shared across projects.
This is important because there are many definitions in the core SWCs
that many projects use -- such as the Flash, AIR, and Flex SWCs -- and
it would waste memory to keep of copy of all of them in each project.
</p>

<p>
For example, consider the <code>UIComponent</code> class
in <code>framework.swc</code>, which extends <code>Sprite</code>,
and consider two Flex projects,
one of which links against <code>playerglogal.swc</code>
and the other links against <code>airglobal.swc</code>.
In one project, the superclass of <code>UIComponent</code>
is the <code>flash.display.Sprite</code> class in
<code>playerglobal.swc</code>; in the other, it is the
<code>flash.display.Sprite</code> class in <code>airglobal.swc</code>.
(They could be different, even though they have the same name.)
Therefore, if we want to have a project-independent class definition
for <code>UIComponent</code>, it cannot refer directly to the definition
for its superclass. Instead, it stores an <code>IReference</code> to
<code>flash.display.Sprite</code>, which gets resolved differently
in the two projects.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, is definition can keep direct references to other definitions.
For example, a function definition keeps direct references to the definitions
for its parameters, and a class definition keeps direct references to the
definitions for its events, styles, and effects.
