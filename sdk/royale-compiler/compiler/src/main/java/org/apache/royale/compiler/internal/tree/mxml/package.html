<body>

This package is the internal counterpart of the external
<code>org.apache.royale.compiler.tree.mxml</code> package.

<p>
It contains classes that implement the MXML node interfaces.
After the AST for a compilation unit has been built,
you should access nodes only through the external interfaces
and never through these internal classes.
The methods in the interfaces are guaranteed to be safe to call
from multiple threads, while the methods in these classes are not.
</p>

<p>
See the <a href="../../package-summary.html#package_description">description</a>
of the <code>org.apache.royale.compiler</code> package for an explanation
of how the compiler code is organized into external and internal packages.
