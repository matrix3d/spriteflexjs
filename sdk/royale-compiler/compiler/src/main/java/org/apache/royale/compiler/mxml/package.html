<body>

This package contains classes and interfaces that provide a syntactic
representation of MXML as tags and attributes, without any semantic
understanding of what those tags and attributes mean in MXML.

<p>
The main class is <code>MXMLData</code>, which represents an entire MXML file.
The content of the file is represented as a list of <code>MXMLUnitData</code>
objects representing <i>MXML units</i>, but there are APIs which allows the
linear list of units to be accessed as a hierarchy of tags that contain other
tags.
<p>

</p>
There are three types of <i>MXML units</i>:
<ul>
<li>An <code>MXMLInstructionData</code> unit represents a processing instruction
such as <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>An <code>MXMLTagData</code> unit represents an <i>open tag</i>
like <code>&lt;Button&gt;</code>, a <i>close tag</i> like
<code>&lt;/Button&gt;</code>, or an <i>empty tag</i> like
<code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code>.
The attributes of an open tag or an empty tag are represented by
<code>MXMLTagAttributeData</code> objects.</li>
<li>An <code>MXMLTextData</code> unit represents character data such as
regular text, whitespace, a CDATA block, or a comment.</li>.
</ul>
