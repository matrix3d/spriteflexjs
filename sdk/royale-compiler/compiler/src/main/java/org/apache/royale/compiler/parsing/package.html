This package contains classes and interfaces involved in parsing
AS and MXML.

<p>
An AS file is tokenized to a sequence of <code>IASToken</code> objects,
using a tokenizer produced by a JFlex <code>.lex</code> file.
The tokens are then used to build an abstract syntax tree for the AS file
whose root is an <code>IFileNode</code>. This process is driven
by a parser produced from an ANTLR <code>.g</code> file.
</p>

<p>
An MXML file is tokenized to a sequence of <code>IMXMLToken</code> objects,
using a tokenizer produced by a JFlex <code>.lex</code> file.
The tokens are then used to build an syntactic representation
of the MXML file as tags and attributes (<code>MXMLData</code>).
An abstract syntax tree for the MXML file is built from the
<code>MXMLData</code>.
