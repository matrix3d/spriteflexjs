<body>

This package contains classes representing various <i>problems</i>
that can be encountered during compilation.

<p>
<i>Problem</i> is a generic term for an error or warning.
Each problem has a <i>default severity</i> classifying it as
<code>CompilerProblemSeverity.ERROR</code>,
<code>CompilerProblemSeverity.WARNING</code>, or
<code>CompilerProblemSeverity.IGNORE</code>.
The severity of any problem can be changed
from the default setting by compiler options.
Ignored problems are simply not reported by clients.
</p>

<p>
Every problem class has an English <code>DESCRIPTION</code> field.
This field can use named placeholders such as <code>${className}</code>;
the value of the corresponding field in the problem object is substituted
when the problem is displayed.
</p>

<p>
An English Java <code>.properties</code> file gets built from the
<code>DESCRIPTION</code> fields and then localized.
