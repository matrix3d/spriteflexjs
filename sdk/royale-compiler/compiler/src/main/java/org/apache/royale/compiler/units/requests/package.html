This package contains interfaces representing a compilation unit's
<i>requests</i> and <i>results</i>.

<p>
You can make five <i>requests</i> on a compilation unit:
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
	<tr>
		<td>Request what?</td>
		<td>Method</td>
		<td>Result</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>AST</td>
		<td><code>getSyntaxTreeRequest()</code></td>
		<td><code>ISyntaxTreeRequestResult</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>File scope</td>
		<td><code>getFileScopeRequest()</code></td>
		<td><code>IFileScopeRequestResult</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Outgoing dependencies</td>
		<td><code>getOutgoingDependenciesRequest()</code></td>
		<td><code>IOutoingDependenciesRequestResult</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ABC</td>
		<td><code>getABCBytesRequest()</code></td>
		<td><code>IABCBytesRequestResult</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>SWF tags</td>
		<td><code>getSWFTagsRequest()</code></td>
		<td><code>ISWFTagsRequestResult</code></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>
It is common for one request to trigger other requests.
For example, if you request the file scope for an AS file,
the AST gets automatically requested.
</p>

<p>
Compilation units use Java <code>Future</code> objects to fulfill
the <i>requests</i>. This allows multiple compilation units to compile
simultaneously on multiple threads.
</p>

<p>
The <i>result</i> objects that come back from the <i>requests</i>
are cached in the compilation unit for subsequent access.
