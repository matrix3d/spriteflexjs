This package contains classes and interface related to <i>workspaces</i>,
which cache project-independent information.

<p>
A <i>workspace</i> is the highest-level concept of the Royale compiler.
To use Royale APIs, you start with a workspace and use it to create
one or more projects.
Information which is not specific to a particular project
gets stored in the workspace, where it can be accessed by any project.
</p>

<p>
The workspace serves as the single point of notification for clients
such as IDEs when files are added, changed, or removed.
</p>

<p>
See the <code>IWorkspace</code> interface for more information.
