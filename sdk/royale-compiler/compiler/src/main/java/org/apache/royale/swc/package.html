<body>

This package and its subpackages contain a support library
for reading, writing, and representing SWC files.

<p>
Currently this support library has some dependencies on classes
in the <code>compiler</code> package. Ideally it would be completely
independent.
</p>

<p>
The immediate contents of this package are classes and interfaces that
model a SWC file.
An <code>ISWC</code> is the root of the data structure representing a SWC file.
The XML elements of the <code>catalog.xml</code> file inside the SWC
are represented by <code>ISWCComponent</code>, <code>ISWCScript</code>, etc.
The <code>library.swf</code> file inside the SWC is represented by
<code>ISWCLibrary</code>.
