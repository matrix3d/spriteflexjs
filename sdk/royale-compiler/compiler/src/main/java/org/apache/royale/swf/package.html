<body>

This package and its subpackages contain a support library
for reading, writing, and representing SWF files.

<p>
Currently this support library has some dependencies on classes
in the <code>compiler</code> package. Ideally it would be completely
independent.
</p>

<p>
The immediate contents of this package are classes and interfaces that
model a SWF file.
An <code>ISWF</code> is the root of the data structure representing a SWF file.
The tags of the SWF are represented by various kinds of <code>ITag</code> objects.
For example, a <code>DoABC</code> tag is represented by a <code>DoABCTag</code>
object.
