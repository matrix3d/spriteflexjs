		 * accurate proofing and more efficient cross-media output. Be aware, though, that color management does not provide 
		 * perfect conversions due to devices having a different gamut from each other or original images. 
		 * Nor does color management eliminate the need for custom or edited profiles. 
		 * Color profiles are dependent on browsers, operating systems (OS), OS extensions, output devices, and application support.Applying color correction degrades the Flash runtime performance. 
		 * A Flash runtime's color correction is document style color correction because
		 * all SWF movies are considered documents with implicit sRGB profiles. 
		 * Use the Stage.colorCorrectionSupport property to tell the Flash runtime 
		 * to correct colors when displaying the SWF file (document) to the display color space.

		 * (Not available for content running in Flash Player.)StageDisplayState.NORMAL Sets the Flash runtime back to the standard stage display mode.The scaling behavior of the movie in full-screen mode is determined by the scaleMode 
		 * setting (set using the Stage.scaleMode property or the SWF file's embed 
		 * tag settings in the HTML file). If the scaleMode property is set to noScale 
		 * while the application transitions to full-screen mode, the Stage width and height 
		 * properties are updated, and the Stage dispatches a resize event. If any other scale mode is set,
		 * the stage and its contents are scaled to fill the new screen dimensions. The Stage object retains its original
		 * width and height values and does not dispatch a resize event.The following restrictions apply to SWF files that play within an HTML page (not those using the stand-alone 
		 * Flash Player or not running in the AIR runtime):To enable full-screen mode, add the allowFullScreen parameter to the object 
		 * and embed tags in the HTML page that includes the SWF file, with allowFullScreen set 
		 * to "true", as shown in the following example:
		 * 
		 *   <codeblock>
		 * <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
		 * ...
		 * <embed src="example.swf" allowFullScreen="true" ... >
		 * </codeblock>
		 * An HTML page may also use a script to generate SWF-embedding tags. You need to alter the script 
		 * so that it inserts the proper allowFullScreen settings. HTML pages generated by Flash Professional and  
		 * Flash Builder use the AC_FL_RunContent() function to embed references to SWF files, and you 
		 * need to add the allowFullScreen parameter settings, as in the following:
		 * <codeblock>
		 * AC_FL_RunContent( ... "allowFullScreen", "true", ... )
		 * </codeblock>
		 * Full-screen mode is initiated in response to a mouse click or key press by the user; the movie cannot change 
		 * Stage.displayState without user input. Flash runtimes restrict keyboard input  in full-screen mode. 
		 * Acceptable keys include keyboard shortcuts that terminate full-screen mode and non-printing keys such as arrows, space, Shift,
		 * and Tab keys. Keyboard shortcuts that terminate full-screen mode are: Escape (Windows, Linux, and Mac), Control+W (Windows), 
		 * Command+W (Mac), and Alt+F4.
		 * A Flash runtime dialog box appears over the movie when users enter full-screen mode to inform the users they are in 
		 * full-screen mode and that they can press the Escape key to end full-screen mode.Starting with Flash Player 9.0.115.0, full-screen works the same in windowless mode as it does in window mode. 
		 * If you set the Window Mode (wmode in the HTML) to Opaque Windowless (opaque) 
		 * or Transparent Windowless (transparent), full-screen can be initiated, 
		 * but the full-screen window will always be opaque.These restrictions are not present for SWF content running in the 
		 * stand-alone Flash Player or in AIR. AIR supports an interactive full-screen mode which allows keyboard input.For AIR content running in full-screen mode, the system screen saver
		 * and power saving options are disabled while video content is playing and until either the video stops 
		 * or full-screen mode is exited.On Linux, setting displayState to StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN or

In this case, the wmodeGPU property value is false.GPU compositing has been requested (if applicable and available), but the environment is operating in "fallback mode" 
		 * (not optimal rendering) due to limitations of the content. In this case, the wmodeGPU property value is true.GPU compositing has been requested (if applicable and available), and the environment is operating in the best mode. In this case, the 
		 * wmodeGPU property value is also true.In other words, the wmodeGPU property identifies the capability and state of the rendering environment. For runtimes 
		 * that do not support GPU compositing, such as AIR 1.5.2, the value is always false, because (as stated above) the value is 
		 * true only when GPU compositing has been requested, is available, and is in use.The wmodeGPU property is useful to determine, at runtime, whether or not GPU compositing is in use. The value of 
		 * wmodeGPU indicates if your content is going to be scaled by hardware, or not, so you can present graphics at the correct size.
		 * You can also determine if you're rendering in a fast path or not, so that you can adjust your content complexity accordingly.For Flash Player in a browser, GPU compositing can be requested by the value of gpu for the wmode HTML 
		 * parameter in the page hosting the SWF file. For other configurations, GPU compositing can be requested in the header of a SWF file 
		 * (set using SWF authoring tools).However, the wmodeGPU property does not identify the current rendering performance. Even if GPU compositing is "in use" the rendering 
		 * process might not be operating in the best mode. To adjust your content for optimal rendering, use a Flash runtime debugger version, 
		 * and set the DisplayGPUBlendsetting in your mm.cfg file.Note: This property is always false when referenced
		 * from ActionScript that runs before the runtime performs its first rendering
		 * pass.  For example, if you examine wmodeGPU from a script in Frame 1 of
		 * Adobe Flash Professional, and your SWF file is the first SWF file loaded in a new
		 * instance of the runtime, then the wmodeGPU value is false.
		 * To get an accurate value, wait until at least one rendering pass
		 * has occurred. If you write an event listener for the

		 * Registers an event listener object with an EventDispatcher object so that the listener 
		 * receives notification of an event. You can register event listeners on all nodes in the 
		 * display list for a specific type of event, phase, and priority.After you successfully register an event listener, you cannot change its priority
		 * through additional calls to addEventListener(). To change a listener's
		 * priority, you must first call removeListener(). Then you can register the
		 * listener again with the new priority level. Keep in mind that after the listener is registered, subsequent calls to
		 * addEventListener() with a different type or
		 * useCapture value result in the creation of a separate listener registration. 
		 * For example, if you first register a listener with useCapture set to 
		 * true, it listens only during the capture phase. If you call 
		 * addEventListener() again using the same listener object, but with
		 * useCapture set to false, you have two separate listeners: one
		 * that listens during the capture phase and another that listens during the target and
		 * bubbling phases.You cannot register an event listener for only the target phase or the bubbling 
		 * phase. Those phases are coupled during registration because bubbling 
		 * applies only to the ancestors of the target node.If you no longer need an event listener, remove it by calling 
		 * removeEventListener(), or memory problems could result. Event listeners are not automatically
		 * removed from memory because the garbage
		 * collector does not remove the listener as long as the dispatching object exists (unless the useWeakReference
		 * parameter is set to true).Copying an EventDispatcher instance does not copy the event listeners attached to it. 
		 * (If your newly created node needs an event listener, you must attach the listener after
		 * creating the node.) However, if you move an EventDispatcher instance, the event listeners 
		 * attached to it move along with it.If the event listener is being registered on a node while an event is being processed
		 * on this node, the event listener is not triggered during the current phase but can be 
		 * triggered during a later phase in the event flow, such as the bubbling phase.If an event listener is removed from a node while an event is being processed on the node,
		 * it is still triggered by the current actions. After it is removed, the event listener is
		 * never invoked again (unless registered again for future processing).
		 * @param	type	The type of event.
		 * @param	listener	The listener function that processes the event. This function must accept
		 *   an Event object as its only parameter and must return nothing, as this example shows:
		 *   <codeblock>
		 *   function(evt:Event):void
		 *   </codeblock>
		 *   The function can have any name.
		 * @param	useCapture	Determines whether the listener works in the capture phase or the 
		 *   target and bubbling phases. If useCapture is set to true, 
		 *   the listener processes the event only during the capture phase and not in the 
		 *   target or bubbling phase. If useCapture is false, the
		 *   listener processes the event only during the target or bubbling phase. To listen for
		 *   the event in all three phases, call addEventListener twice, once with 
		 *   useCapture set to true, then again with
		 *   useCapture set to false.
		 * @param	priority	The priority level of the event listener. The priority is designated by
		 *   a signed 32-bit integer. The higher the number, the higher the priority. All listeners
		 *   with priority n are processed before listeners of priority n-1. If two
		 *   or more listeners share the same priority, they are processed in the order in which they
		 *   were added. The default priority is 0.
		 * @param	useWeakReference	Determines whether the reference to the listener is strong or
		 *   weak. A strong reference (the default) prevents your listener from being garbage-collected.
		 *   A weak reference does not. Class-level member functions are not subject to garbage 
		 *   collection, so you can set useWeakReference to true for 
		 *   class-level member functions without subjecting them to garbage collection. If you set
		 *   useWeakReference to true for a listener that is a nested inner 
		 *   function, the function will be garbage-collected and no longer persistent. If you create 
		 *   references to the inner function (save it in another variable) then it is not
